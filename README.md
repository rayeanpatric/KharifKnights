## Model Details

AgriVision uses ONNX models for pest detection and nutrient prediction.

*   **Pest Detection Model:**
    *   **Input:** Image data (224x224 pixels, NCHW format).
    *   **Output:** A tensor of shape `[1, 9, 1029]` containing bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and class probabilities for each potential detection.
    *   **Labels:** The `public/models/pest_detection_labels.yaml` file maps class indices to pest names.

*   **Nutrient Prediction Models (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium):**
    *   **Input:** Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture values.
    *   **Output:** Predicted nutrient levels (kg/ha).
